    strategy: |
      Portfolio strategy based on BCG Growth-Share Matrix:
      
      STARS (invest heavily):
      - Cloud Platform (PD00002): Market leader in high-growth market
        → Invest to defend leadership position and build future cash cow
      
      CASH COWS (maintain and harvest):
      - Legacy Enterprise Platform (PD00001): Dominant in mature market
        → Maintain market share, maximize cash flow to fund stars
      
      QUESTION MARKS (selective investment):
      - IoT Sensor Platform (PD00003): High growth but low share
        → Evaluate: Can we achieve leadership? If yes, invest. If no, divest.
        → Decision criteria: technology advantage, partnership opportunities, customer traction
      
      DOGS (harvest or divest):
      - On-premise Legacy Tool (PD00004): Declining market, weak position
        → Plan orderly exit over 18 months
        → Migrate customers to Cloud Platform where possible
        → Sunset without new investment
      
      PORTFOLIO BALANCE:
      - Currently: 1 star, 1 cash cow, 1 question mark, 1 dog
      - Target: Grow stars, maintain cash cows, resolve question marks, exit dogs
      - Investment allocation: 60% to stars, 30% to cash cows, 10% to question marks
